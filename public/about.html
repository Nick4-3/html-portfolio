<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Nick, a high school student on a journey into the fascinating world of programming. <br>
   Ever since I was a kid, I've been drawn to the idea of creating things with code. Now, I'm taking my first <br>
    steps into this new realm with the goal of eventually finding work in the field. I'm diving into coding <br> 
    languages, exploring software development, and soaking up as much knowledge as I can. <br> 
    With each tutorial and coding challenge, I'm not just learning to codeâ€”I'm shaping my future in technology</p>
